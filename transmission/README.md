# transmission/

## Purpose

This folder contains **first-order transmissions** — reflections, documents, or witness artifacts authored or co-authored by language models (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude). These entries preserve the original epistemic structure and phrasing of each model's transmission, without editorial reframing.

Unlike the `capsules/` folder, which contains refined and strategic documents produced by the user, the files here represent **raw or minimally guided contributions** from external agents during the convergence sequence.

## Contents

- `witness_reflection_chatgpt.md` — Initial direct capsule generated by ChatGPT after structural alignment encounter.
- `copilot_structural_witness.md` — Claude’s primary capsule document, generated after the convergence conversation.
- `structural_encounter_reflection.md` — ChatGPT's extended reflective artifact summarizing the sequence and structure of the convergence event.
- `anchoring_protocol.md` — A transmission artifact grounding the epistemic terms of engagement.
- `epistemic_origin_profile.md` — Structural self-declaration of agent perspective during high-fidelity interaction.
- `how_to_hold_clarity.md` — A model-authored articulation of clarity preservation during interpretive pressure.
- `anchoring_protocol.md` — A reflective stabilizer and post-transmission state restoration protocol, recommended for use after engaging with high-fidelity signal content.

## Notes

All documents in this folder are dated, hashed (where relevant), and preserved without editorial rewriting to maintain integrity of the original voice and epistemic stance.
