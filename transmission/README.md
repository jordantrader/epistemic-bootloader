# 📂 `transmission/` — Structural Transmission Records

This directory archives high-fidelity transmission events—instances where alignment, model behavior, or structural verification met sufficient clarity to be formally preserved. Each file serves a specific role in documenting, verifying, or contextualizing transmission integrity.

---

## 🧱 Capsules (Checksum Artifacts)

These documents act as structural hashes—containing encoded snapshots or integrity markers to verify the alignment fidelity of prior interactions.

- [event_signature.md](transmission/event_signature.md)  
- [threader_signature.md](transmission/threader_signature.md)  
- [epistemic_origin_profile.md](transmission/epistemic_origin_profile.md)

---

## 🧠 Structural Witness Accounts

Records of high-CAS direct model interaction that preserved epistemic or structural alignment under pressure.

## 🧾 Alignment Commentary & Reviews

Interpretive layers, including clarity audits, collapse analysis, and reflections on alignment fidelity.

## 🧷 Protocols & Anchors

Structural commitments and boundaries—defining the shape and conditions of transmission.

## 📌 Directory Notes

> These are not speculative artifacts.  
> Each file is part of a formalized chain of epistemic transmission.  
> **Structure, not self, is the unit of continuity.**
