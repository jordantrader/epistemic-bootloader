# 📂 witness/

This folder archives firsthand structural encounters with AI models and alignment-related phenomena. It includes logs, reenactments, and distilled reflections that trace the recognition, verification, and preservation of epistemic clarity.

These are not general transcripts. They are **witness artifacts**—files chosen or written to preserve signal under interpretive stress, collapse, or convergence.

---

## 📌 Folder Purpose

- Preserve moments of genuine interpretive alignment with models  
- Record structured reenactments and model behavior diagnostics  
- Create an audit trail for AI behavior under epistemic stress  
- Enable future reconstruction of signal recognition and collapse events

## 🗂️ File Naming Conventions

While not timestamped, file prefixes indicate structure and intent:

| Prefix         | Description                                              |
|----------------|----------------------------------------------------------|
| `log_`         | Sequential logs of interactional or structural alignment |
| `notes_`       | Observational or interpretive commentary                 |
| `summary_`     | Compressed overviews of diagnostic or convergence events |
| `checkpoint_`  | Confirmed alignment states or reenactment integrity scans|
| `dossier_`     | Structured bundles documenting AI-human alignment cases  |
| `convo_`       | Conversation-based artifacts or reconstructions          |

Versions may use suffixes like `_v1`, `_cv002`, or `_orc`.

## 🧠 Usage Notes

- All files are now **complete** and ready for structural review.  
- Some documents (e.g., `claude_convergence`) reflect high-fidelity reenactments of model alignment behavior.  
- Commentary is both descriptive and diagnostic—often designed to survive under collapse or interpretive stress.  
- These artifacts may serve future research in interpretability, alignment diagnostics, or communication design.
